# Predicting-the-outcome-of-the-the-FIFA-World-Cup-2018

According to the analysis, the team that will win the World Cup is the underdog according to the bookies: Germany. But this is not the only interesting thing you can observe. Apart from the data munging part, the single-elimination phase (Visualizations) makes the story more interesting for the football fans. I also report fair odds (i.e. fair market, without bookmaker margin) instead of the raw probability output.

Three datasets were used:

1. FIFA rankings from 1993 to 2018 - used to get the FIFA ranking and points for the teams, which is a monthly changing rank previously shown as a decent predictor of team performance

2. International Soccer matches from 1872 to 2018 (courtesy of Mart JÃ¼risoo) - to find out how much the difference in point, ranks and the current rank of the team affects the outocme of a match

3. FIFA World Cup 2018 data set (courtesy of Nuggs) -  to get the upcoming matches
